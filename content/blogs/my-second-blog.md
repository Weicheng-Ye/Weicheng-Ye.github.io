- Thoughts on academic collaboration
- Future research directions

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write about:

1. My recent paper on topological quantum field theory
2. Experiences from recent conferences
3. Teaching and mentoring experiences
4. Book recommendations for physics students

Stay tuned for more updates!
